# Artur's NixOS & Nix Home Manager configurations

This repository contains NixOS configuration for my desktop, personal laptop, a small VM running on Proxmox, and a Home Manager confiruation for my work laptop. The configurations are based on a [Nix flake](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) for easy management and configuration. Minor changes are made in `devel` branch which are then merged into `main` branch.
